# overall mentat impressions
Not super impressed with Mentat. Code didn't work. Lots of copy and pasting from the CLI to mentat.

# win10 environment
python -m venv .venv



cd .venv .\Scripts\activate

pip install -r requirements.txt

(for my little effort to get mentat to write a simple full stack application)

git init

Make sure to git ignore  your venv folder! :)
